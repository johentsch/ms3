ms3 - Parsing MuseScore 3 and 4
===============================

    Plan to use

Welcome to **ms3**, a Python library for parsing `MuseScore <https://musescore.org/en/download>`__ files.

What is it?
===========

``ms3`` is a parser for MuseScore files, serving as data factory for annotated music corpora.

* parses MuseScore 3 and 4 files, dispensing with lossy conversion to musicXML. The file formats in question are

  * uncompressed ``*.mscx`` files,
  * compressed ``*.mscz`` files,

* extracts and processes the information contained in one or many scores in the form of
  `DataFrames <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html#dataframe>`__:

  * **notes** (start, duration, pitch etc.) and/or rests,
  * **measures** (time signature, lengths, repeat structure etc.)
  * **labels**, such as

    * guitar/Jazz chord labels
    * arbitrary annotation labels
    * **expanded** harmony labels following the `DCML annotation standard <https://github.com/DCMLab/standards>`__
    * **cadences** (part of the same annotation syntax)
    * **form_labels** (annotation standard currently in press)

  * **chords**, that is, onset positions that have musical markup attached, e.g. dynamics, lyrics, slurs, 8va signs...
  * **metadata** from the respective fields, but also score statistics, such as length, number of notes, etc.

* stores the extracted information in a uniform and interoperable tabular format (``*.tsv``)
* writes information from tabular ``*.tsv`` files into MuseScore files, especially

  * chord and annotation labels
  * metadata
  * header information (title, subtitle, etc.)
  * note coloring

* uses a locally installed or standalone MuseScore executable for

  * batch-converting files to any output format supported by MuseScore (mscz, mscx, mp3, midi, pdf etc.)
  * on-the-fly converting any file that MuseScore can read (including MuseScore 2, cap, capx, midi, and musicxml) to parse it

* offers its functionality via the convenient ``ms3`` commandline interface.

Who is it for?
==============

The library is mainly targeted at music researchers and Music Information Retrieval applications. However,
it also serves a wider public of practicing musicians, composers, and music enthusiasts who need to extract or
manipulate score information.

Installation
============

ms3 requires Python >= 3.10 (type ``python3 --version`` to check). Once you have switched to a virtual environment
that has Python 3.10 installed you can pip-install the library via one of the two commands::

    python3 -m pip install ms3
    pip install ms3

If successful, the installation will make the ``ms3`` commands available in your PATH (test by typing ``ms3``).

Quick demo
==========

Parsing a single score
----------------------

.. code-block:: python

    import ms3
    score = ms3.Score('musescore_file.mscz')

Parsing a corpus
----------------

.. code-block:: python

    import ms3
    corpus = ms3.Corpus('score_directory')
    corpus.parse()

Parsing several corpora
-----------------------

.. code-block:: python

    import ms3
    corpora = ms3.Parse('my_research_corpora')
    corpora.parse()
