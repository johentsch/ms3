# Manual

This page is a detailed guide for using ms3 for different tasks. The code examples
suppose you are working in an interactive Python interpreter such as
IPython, Jupyter, Google Colab, or simply in the Python console. The manual itself
is written as a [MyST markdown Notebook](https://myst-nb.readthedocs.io/) which can be run
in Jupyter if the [Jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io) extension is installed.

## Good to know

The principal *raison d'Ãªtre* of `ms3` is for extracting different types of information,
"facets", from MuseScore files and to store them in the form of tabular `.tsv` files,
[Tab-separated values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values), for further processing.
Over the years, however, it has gained additional functionality related to corpus curation.
Therefore, the package operates on a couple of principles that have co-evolved together
with the [DCML corpus initiative](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/dcml/projects/corpus-project/).

(corpus_structure)=

### Corpus structure

`ms3` follows a one-folder-per-feature approach (rather than a one-folder-per-file approach).

#### The default

The library's main command, `ms3 extract`, creates this folder-based structure by default.
Consider this fresh `corpus_before` containing only the folder `MS3` with
7 uncompressed MuseScore files in `.mscx` format:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-input]

#%cd manual
!tree --fromfile corpus_before
```

The default command that is used on all [DCML corpora](https://github.com/DCMLab/dcml_corpora),
`ms3 extract -M -N -X -D -a` extracts three TSV files (measures, notes and "eXpanded" harmonies)
from each score and places them in a separate folder, plus an additional `metadata.tsv` file:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-input]

!tree --fromfile corpus_after
```

`ms3` operates on the fundamental principle that files that belong together need to
have the same name (but not necessarily the same extension). For example, each of the
folders has a file called `BWV_0815` but the folder `harmonies` contains only four files
because the other three did not contain harmony labels.

The folder structure results from the command's default arguments which are equivalent to
`ms3 extract -M ../measures -N ../notes -X ../harmonies`. While there are multiple
ways of specifying output folders (see [below](specifying_folders)), there is an
additional mechanism for cases in which outputs are to be placed within the same
folder (which is probematic when they have the same name):

#### Using suffixes

Users who need their outputs in the same directory, say `out`, can specify the flag `-s`
to add suffixes to the file names. For example, using
`ms3 extract -M out -N out -X out -s` you would get:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-input]

!tree --fromfile out
```

Based on these two principles, default folder and suffix names,
`ms3` is able to recognize which facet of which piece the files
represent and to relate them to each other.

+++

(keys_and_ids)=
### Keys and IDs

```{note} ms3 version 1.0.0 and successors widely replace the mechanisms related to
the parameter `key`. Newer versions, instead, use IDs such as
`corpus_name` and `(corpus_name, piece_name)`. If you come across a method
where the first parameter is called `key`, you are likely dealing with an
older version, or with a [ms3.Score](Score) object.
```

IDs are tuples that are used to identify corpora, pieces and files:

* `'corpus_name'` identifies a corpus, a collection of pieces.
  * `ms3.Parse[corpus_name] -> Corpus`.
* `'piece'` identifies a piece by its file name without any suffixes.
  * `ms3.Corpus[piece] -> Piece`
  * `ms3.Parse[(corpus_name, piece)] -> Piece`
* Integers identify individual files and are unique within a Corpus.
  * `ms3.Piece[i] -> File`
  * `ms3.Corpus[(piece, i)] -> File`
  * `ms3.Parse[(corpus_name, piece, i)] -> File`

#### The importance of the `piece` ID

The piece IDs `piece` relate to the file names in this way: `piece[suffix].ext`.
In order to correctly match files together that belong together, without doing
complicated string matching, `ms3` relies on a list of pieces that it will
expect to be present in a column called `piece` in a file called `metadata.tsv`
(see below). Generally, this should be the first column in these files,
used as index.

```{hint}
If you find yourself stuck with `ms3` producing no output,
it is likely because no `metadata.tsv` is present. In this case, use the option
`-a` to parse everything regardless, and `-D` to create a `metadata.tsv`.
```

+++

(metadata_tsv)=
### The important role of metadata

As mentioned above, `ms3` relies on the `piece` as ID of a piece and uses
it to identify the various files belonging to it although they may come
with additional suffixes (e.g. `_reviewed`) and be scattered all over the
corpus. Importantly, it uses and expects a file called `metadata.tsv` that
lists all piece IDs of the corpus in a column called `piece`. Scores and
other files whose names do not begin with any of strings in that column
are excluded. Files, on the other hand, that begin with any of the strings
are recognized to belong to this piece and to have a suffix, if they do.

Therefore, creating a `metadata.tsv` is an important first step before
using `ms3` to its full potential. This is done by nagivating to the corpus
directory and calling `ms3 extract -a -D`, where `-D` stands for "metadata"
and `-a` for "all", i.e. the directive to process all detected scores,
including those not listed in a `metadata.tsv` file.

Relying on a particular control file in that manner makes it
easy to systematically exclude particular scores from processing (by
dropping them from the table) or to mark alternative versions of a score by
adding a suffix and not listing them individually. `ms3` will recognize
them as alternatives and, based on the current [View](views_manual), include them
or not. As an additional feature, you may pre-configure multiple views of
the corpus by storing their selection of piece IDs in additional
`metadata[_suffix].tsv` files. This example file would lead `ms3` to make
available an additional view called `suffix`. View the chapter on views
below to learn more.

+++

(views_manual)=
### Views

This chapter still needs to be written. In short:

You can access the view of [Piece](Piece), [Corpus](Corpus), and [Parse](Parse) objects,
using the accessor `.view`. The two main methods of a [View](View) object are `.include(category, *strings_to_include)` and
`.exclude(category, *strings_to_exclude)`. Every view has a name which you can use as an accessor to change the relevant
object's view. For example, new objects come with the views "default" and "all", so if you have a Corpus object stored under
the variable `c`, typing `c.all` will activate the view that shows everything.

+++

(label_types)=
### Label types

ms3 recognizes and disambiguates different types of labels, depending on
how they are encoded in MuseScore, see
{ref}`harmony_layer`.

Independent of the type, ms3 will also try to infer whether a label
conforms to the DCML syntax and/or other regular expressions registered
via {py:meth}`~.Score.new_type`. The column
{ref}`regex_match` contains for
each label the name of the first regEx that matched. information will
appear with a subtype, e.g. `0 (dcml)`.

See also {py:meth}`~.Score.infer_label_types`.

+++

(mc_vs_mn)=
### Measure counts (MC) vs. measure numbers (MN)

Measure counts are strictly increasing numbers for all \<measure\> nodes
in the score, regardless of their length. This information is crucial
for correctly addressing positions in a MuseScore file and are shown in
the software\'s status bar. The first measure is always counted as 1
(following MuseScore\'s convention), even if it is an anacrusis.

Measure numbers are the traditional way by which humans refer to
positions in a score. They follow a couple of conventions which can be
summarised as counting complete bars. Quite often, a complete bar (MN)
can be made up of two \<measure\> nodes (MC). In the context of this
library, score addressability needs to be maintained for humans and
computers, therefore a mapping MC -\> MN is preserved in the score
information DataFrames.

+++

(onsets)=
### Onset positions

Onsets express positions of events in a score as their distance from the
beginning of the corresponding {ref}`MC or MN <mc_vs_mn>`. The distances are expressed as fractions of a whole note.
In other words, beat 1 has onset `0`, an event on beat 2 of a 4/4 meter
has onset `1/4` and so on.

Since there are two ways of referencing measures (MC and MN), there are
also two ways of expressing onsets:

-   `mc_onset` expresses the distance from the corresponding MC
-   `mn_onset` expresses the distance from the corresponding MN

In most cases, the two values value will be identical, but take as an
example the case where a 4/4 measure with MN 8 is divided into MC 9 of
length 3/4 and MC 10 of length 1/4 because of a repeat sign or a double
bar line. Since MC 9 corresponds to the first part of MN 8, the two
onset values are identical. But for the anacrusis on beat 4, the values
differ: `mc_onset` is `0` but `mn_onset` is `3/4` because this is the
distance from MN 8.

+++

(read_only)=
### Read-only mode

For parsing faster using less memory. Scores parsed in read-only mode
cannot be changed because the original XML structure is not kept in
memory.

+++

(fifths)=
### Stacks-of-fifths intervals

In order to express note names (tonal pitch classes,
{ref}`tpc <tpc>`), and scale degrees, ms3 uses
stacks of fifths (the only way to express these as a single integer).
For note names, `0` corresponds to C, for scale degrees to the local
tonic.

| fifths | note name | interval | scale degree    |
|--------|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| -6     | Gb        | d5       | b5              |
| -5     | Db        | m2       | b2              |
| -4     | Ab        | m6       | b6 (6 in minor) |
| -3     | Eb        | m3       | b3 (3 in minor) |
| -2     | Bb        | m7       | b7 (7 in minor) |
| -1     | F         | P4       | 4               |
| 0      | C         | P1       | 1               |
| 1      | G         | P5       | 5               |
| 2      | D         | M2       | 2               |
| 3      | A         | M6       | 6 (#6 in minor) |
| 4      | E         | M3       | 3 (#3 in minor) |
| 5      | B         | M7       | 7 (#7 in minor) |
| 6      | F#        | A4       | #4              |

+++

(voltas)=

### Voltas

\"Prima/Seconda volta\" is the Italian designation for \"First/Second
time\". Therefore, in the context of ms3, we refer to \'a volta\' as one
of several endings. By convention, all endings should have the same
measure numbers (MN), which are often differentiated by lowercase
letters, e.g. `8a` for the first ending and `8b` for the second ending.
In MuseScore, correct bar numbers can be achieved by excluding `8b` from
the count or, if the endings have more than one bar, by subtracting the
corresponding number from the second ending\'s count. For example, in
order to achieve the correct MNs `[7a 8a][7b 8b]`, you would add `-2` to
7b\'s count which otherwise would come out as 9.

ms3 checks for incorrect MNs and warns you if the score needs
correction. It will also ask you to make all voltas the same length. If
this is not possible for editorial reasons (although often the length of
the second volta is arbitrary), ignore the warning and check in the
{ref}`measures <measures>` table if the MN are
correct for your purposes.

+++

(facets_manual)=
## Facets

This section gives an overview of the various tables that ms3 exposes
after parsing a MuseScore file. Their names, e.g. `measures`, correspond
to the properties of {any}`Score`
and the methods of {any}`Parse`
with which they can be retrieved. They come as
{any}`pandas.DataFrame` objects. The available
tables are:

All score information, except the metadata, is contained in the
following two tables:

-   {ref}`measures <measures>`
-   {ref}`notes <notes>`
-   {ref}`rests <rests>`
-   {ref}`notes_and_rests <notes_and_rests>`
-   {ref}`chords <chords>`: **Not to be
    confounded with labels or chord annotations**, a chord is a
    notational unit in which all included notes are part of the same
    notational layer and have the same onset and duration. Every chord
    has a `chord_id` and every note is part of a chord. These tables are
    used to convey score information that is not attached to a
    particular note, such as lyrics, staff text, dynamics and other
    markup.
-   {ref}`labels <labels>`
-   {ref}`expanded <expanded>`
-   {ref}`cadences <cadences>`
-   {ref}`events <events>`

For each of the available tables you will see an example and you can
click on the columns to learn about their meanings.

(measures)=

### Measures

DataFrame representing the measures in the MuseScore file (which can be
incomplete measures, see {ref}`mc_vs_mn`)
together with their respective features. Required for unfolding repeats.

```python
>>> s.mscx.measures()            # from a Score object
>>> P.measures()                 # from a Piece object
>>> c.measures()                 # from a Corpus object
>>> p.get_facet('measures')      # from a Parse object
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-input]

import ms3
c = ms3.Corpus("../../old_tests", level='c')
c.parse_scores()
c.measures()
```

(notes)=

### Notes

DataFrame representing the notes in the MuseScore file.

```python
>>> s.mscx.notes()            # from a Score object
>>> P.notes()                 # from a Piece object
>>> c.notes()                 # from a Corpus object
>>> p.get_facet('notes')      # from a Parse object
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-input]

c.notes()
```

(rests)=

### Rests

DataFrame representing the rests in the MuseScore file.

``` python
>>> s.mscx.rests()            # from a Score object
>>> P.rests()                 # from a Piece object
>>> c.rests()                 # from a Corpus object
>>> p.get_facet('rests')      # from a Parse object
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-input]

c.rests()
```

(notes_and_rests)=

### Notes and Rests

DataFrame combining {ref}`notes` and
{ref}`rests`.

``` python
>>> s.mscx.notes_and_rests()          # from a Score object
>>> P.notes_and_rests()               # from a Piece object
>>> c.notes_and_rests()               # from a Corpus object
>>> p.get_facet('notes_and_rests')    # from a Parse object
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-input]

c.notes_and_rests()
```

(chords)=

### Chords

```{note}
The word "chords", here, is used in a very specific way and is misleading.
It has been adopted from the MuseScore XML source code but is better
understood as "note tuple with unique onset position". If you are interested
in chord labels, please refer to {ref}`labels` or {ref}`expanded`.
```

In a MuseScore file, every note is enclosed by a \<Chord\> tag. One
\<Chord\> tag can enclose several notes, as long as they occur in the
same {ref}`staff <staff>` and
{ref}`voice <voice>` (notational layer). As a
consequence, notes belonging to the same \<Chord\> have the same onset
and the same duration.

**Why chord lists?** Most of the markup (such as articulation, lyrics
etc.) in a MuseScore file is attached not to individual notes but
instead to \<Chord\> tags. It might be a matter of interpretation to
what notes exactly the symbols pertain, which is why it is left for the
interested user to link the chord list with the corresponding note list
by joining on the {ref}`chord_id <chord_id>`
column of each.

#### Standard columns

The output of the analogous commands depends on what markup is available
in the score ({ref}`see below <chords_dynamic>`). The columns that are always present in a chord list are
exactly the same as (and correspond to) those of a
{ref}`note list <notes>` except for
{ref}`tied <tied>`,
{ref}`tpc <tpc>`, and
{ref}`midi <midi>`.

Such a reduced table -- or one with precisely selected features to extract --
can be retrieved using
[Score.mscx.parsed.get_chords(mode='strict')](bs4_parser._MSCX_bs4.get_chords)
{any}`bs4_parser._MSCX_bs4.get_chords`.
However, most of the time users will be interested to automatically retrieve
all markup present in the score (as far as `ms3` goes), see below.

(chords_dynamic)=
#### Dynamic columns

Leaving the standard columns aside, the normal interface for accessing
chord lists calls
{any}`Score.mscx.parsed.get_chords(mode='auto') <bs4_parser._MSCX_bs4.get_chords>` meaning that only columns are included that have at least
one non empty value. The following table shows the first two non-empty
values for each column when parsing all scores included in the [ms3
repository](https://github.com/johentsch/ms3) for demonstration
purposes:

``` python
>>> s.mscx.chords()          # from a Score object
>>> P.chords()               # from a Piece object
>>> c.chords()               # from a Corpus object
>>> p.get_facet('chords')    # from a Parse object
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-input]

c.chords()
```

+++ {"tags": []}

(labels)=
### Labels

DataFrame representing the annotation labels contained in the score. The
output can be controlled by changing the `labels_cfg` configuration.

``` python
>>> s.mscx.labels()          # from a Score object
>>> P.labels()               # from a Piece object
>>> c.labels()               # from a Corpus object
>>> p.get_facet('labels')    # from a Parse object
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-input]

c.labels()
```

(expanded)=
### Expanded

If the score contains [DCML harmony
labels](https://github.com/DCMLab/standards), this DataFrames represents
them after splitting them into the encoded features and translating them
into scale degrees.

``` python
>>> s.mscx.expanded()          # from a Score object
>>> P.expanded()               # from a Piece object
>>> c.expanded()               # from a Corpus object
>>> p.get_facet('expanded')    # from a Parse object
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-input]

c.expanded()
```

(cadences)=

### Cadences

If DCML harmony labels include cadence labels, return only those. This
table is simply a filter on {ref}`expanded <expanded>`. The table has the same columns and contains only rows that
include a cadence label. Just for convenience\...

``` python
>>> s.mscx.cadences()          # from a Score object
>>> P.cadences()               # from a Piece object
>>> c.cadences()               # from a Corpus object
>>> p.get_facet('cadences')    # from a Parse object
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-input]

c.cadences()
```

(form_labels)=
### Form labels

``` python
>>> s.mscx.form_labels()          # from a Score object
>>> P.form_labels()               # from a Piece object
>>> c.form_labels()               # from a Corpus object
>>> p.get_facet('form_labels')    # from a Parse object
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-input]

c.form_labels()
```

### Events

This DataFrame is the original tabular representation of the MuseScore
file\'s source code from which all other tables, except `measures` are
generated. The nested XML tags are transformed into column names.

The value `'â'` is used for empty tags. For example, in the column
`Chord/Spanner/Slur` it would correspond to the tag structure
(formatting as in an MSCX file):

``` xml
<Chord>
  <Spanner type="Slur">
    <Slur>
      </Slur>
    </Spanner>
  </Chord>
```

The value `'/'` on the other hand represents a shortcut empty tag. For
example, in the column `Chord/grace16` it would correspond to the tag
structure (formatting as in an MSCX file):

``` xml
<Chord>
  <grace16/>
  </Chord>
```


## Parsing

This chapter explains how to

- parse a single score to access and manipulate the contained information using a {py:class}`~.score.Score` object
- parse a group of scores to access and manipulate the contained information using a {py:class}`~.parse.Parse` object.

### Parsing a single score


Import the library.
: To parse a single score, we will use the class {py:class}`~.score.Score`. We could import the whole library:

  ```python
  >>> import ms3
  >>> s = ms3.Score()
  ```

  or simply import the class:

  ```python
  >>> from ms3 import Score
  >>> s = Score()
  ```

Locate the [MuseScore 3](https://musescore.org/en/download) score you want to parse.
: :::{tip}
  MSCZ files are ZIP files containing the uncompressed MSCX. In order to trace the score's version history,
  it is recommended to always work with MSCX files.
  :::

  In the examples, we parse the annotated first page of Giovanni
  Battista Pergolesi's influential *Stabat Mater*. The file is called `stabat.mscx` and can be downloaded from
  [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johentsch/ms3/master/docs/stabat.mscx) (open link and key `Ctrl + S` to save the file
  or right-click on the link to `Save link as...`).

Create a {py:class}`~.score.Score` object.
: In the example, the MuseScore 3 file is located at `~/ms3/docs/stabat.mscx` so we can simply create the object
  and bind it to the variable `s` like so:

  ```python
  >>> from ms3 import Score
  >>> s = Score('~/ms3/docs/stabat.mscx')
  ```

Inspect the object.
: To have a look at the created object we can simply evoke its variable:

  ```python
  >>> s
  MuseScore file
  --------------

  ~/ms3/docs/stabat.mscx

  Attached annotations
  --------------------

  48 labels:
  staff  voice  label_type  color_name
  3      2      0 (dcml)    default       48
  ```

  % .. program-output:: python examples/parse_single_score.py

#### Parsing options

```{eval-rst}
.. automethod:: ms3.score.Score.__init__
    :noindex:
```

### Parsing multiple scores


Import the library.
: To parse multiple scores, we will use the class {py:class}`ms3.Parse <.parse.Parse>`. We could import the whole library:

  ```python
  >>> import ms3
  >>> p = ms3.Parse()
  ```

  or simply import the class:

  ```python
  >>> from ms3 import Parse
  >>> p = Parse()
  ```

Locate the folder containing MuseScore files.
: In this example, we are going to parse all files included in the [ms3 repository](https://github.com/johentsch/ms3) which has been
  [cloned](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository/git-clone)
  into the home directory and therefore has the path `~/ms3`.

Create a {py:class}`~.parse.Parse` object
: The object is created by calling it with the directory to scan, and bound to the typical variable `p`.
  ms3 scans the subdirectories for corpora (see {ref}`corpus_structure`) and assigns keys automatically based on
  folder names (here 'docs', and 'tests'):

  ```python
  >>> from ms3 import Parse
  >>> p = Parse('~/ms3')
  >>> p
  ```

  ```{eval-rst}
  .. program-output:: python examples/parse_directory.py
  ```

  Without any further parameters, ms3 detects only file types that it can potentially parse, i.e. MSCX, MSCZ, and TSV.
  In the following example, we infer the location of our local MuseScore 3 installation (if 'auto' fails,
  indicate the path to your executable). As a result, ms3 also shows formats that MuseScore can convert, such as
  XML, MIDI, or CAP.

  ```python
  >>> from ms3 import Parse
  >>> p = Parse('~/ms3', ms='auto')
  >>> p
  ```

  ```{eval-rst}
  .. program-output:: python examples/parse_directory_xml.py
  ```

  By default, present TSV files are detected and can be parsed as well, allowing one to access already extracted
  information without parsing the scores anew. In order to select only particular files, a regular expression
  can be passed to the parameter `file_re`. In the following example, only files ending on `mscx` are collected
  in the object (`$` stands for the end of the filename, without it, files including the string 'mscx' anywhere
  in their names would be selected, too):

  :::{caution}
  The parameter `key` will be deprecated from version 0.6.0 onwards. See {ref}`keys_and_ids`.
  :::

  ```python
  >>> from ms3 import Parse
  >>> p = Parse('~/ms3', file_re='mscx$', key='ms3')
  >>> p
  ```

  ```{eval-rst}
  .. program-output:: python examples/parse_directory_mscx.py
  ```

  In this example, we assigned the key `'ms3'`. Note that the same MSCX files that were distributed over several keys
  in the previous example are now grouped together. Keys allow operations to be performed on a particular group of
  selected files. For example, we could add MSCX files from another folder using the method
  {py:meth}`~.parse.Parse.add_dir`:

  ```python
  >>> p.add_dir('~/other_folder', file_re='mscx$')
  >>> p
  ```

  ```{eval-rst}
  .. program-output:: python examples/parse_other_directory.py

  ```

Parse the scores.
: In order to simply parse all registered MuseScore files, call the method {py:meth}`~.parse.Parse.parse_mscx`.
  Instead, you can pass the argument `keys` to parse only one (or several)
  selected group(s) to save time. The argument `level` controls how many
  log messages you see; here, it is set to 'critical' or 'c' to suppress all
  warnings:

  ```python
  >>> p.parse_mscx(keys='ms3', level='c')
  >>> p
  ```

  ```{eval-rst}
  .. program-output:: python examples/parse_key.py
  ```

  As we can see, only the files with the key 'ms3' were parsed and the
  table shows an overview of the counts of the included label types in the
  different notational layers (i.e. staff & voice), grouped by their colours.

#### Parsing options

```{eval-rst}
.. automethod:: ms3.parse.Parse.__init__
    :noindex:

```

## Extracting score information

One of ms3's main functionalities is storing the information contained in parsed scores as tabular files (TSV format).
More information on the generated files is summarized {ref}`here <tabular_info>`

### Using the commandline

The most convenient way to achieve this is the command `ms3 extract` and its capital-letter parameters summarize
the available tables:

```console
-M [folder], --measures [folder]
                    Folder where to store TSV files with measure information needed for tasks such as unfolding repetitions.
-N [folder], --notes [folder]
                    Folder where to store TSV files with information on all notes.
-R [folder], --rests [folder]
                    Folder where to store TSV files with information on all rests.
-L [folder], --labels [folder]
                    Folder where to store TSV files with information on all annotation labels.
-X [folder], --expanded [folder]
                    Folder where to store TSV files with expanded DCML labels.
-F [folder], --form_labels [folder]
                    Folder where to store TSV files with all form labels.
-E [folder], --events [folder]
                    Folder where to store TSV files with all events (chords, rests, articulation, etc.) without further processing.
-C [folder], --chords [folder]
                    Folder where to store TSV files with <chord> tags, i.e. groups of notes in the same voice with identical onset and duration. The tables
                    include lyrics, dynamics, articulation, staff- and system texts, tempo marking, spanners, and thoroughbass figures.
-D [suffix], --metadata [suffix]
                    Set -D to update the 'metadata.tsv' files of the respective corpora with the parsed scores. Add a suffix if you want to update
                    'metadata{suffix}.tsv' instead.
```

The typical way to use this command for a corpus of scores is to keep the MuseScore files in a subfolder (called,
for example, `MS3`) and to use the parameters' default values, effectively creating additional subfolders for each
extracted aspect next to each folder containing MuseScore files. For example if we take the folder structure of
the [ms3 repository](https://github.com/johentsch/ms3):

```console
ms3
âââ docs
âÂ Â  âââ cujus.mscx
âÂ Â  âââ o_quam.mscx
âÂ Â  âââ quae.mscx
âÂ Â  âââ stabat.mscx
âââ tests
    âââ MS3
    âÂ Â  âââ 05_symph_fant.mscx
    âÂ Â  âââ 76CASM34A33UM.mscx
    âÂ Â  âââ BWV_0815.mscx
    âÂ Â  âââ D973deutscher01.mscx
    âÂ Â  âââ Did03M-Son_regina-1762-Sarti.mscx
    âÂ Â  âââ K284-3_section_breaks.mscx
    âÂ Â  âââ stabat_03_coloured.mscx
    âââ repeat_dummies
        âââ repeats0.mscx
        âââ repeats1.mscx
        âââ repeats2.mscx
```

Upon calling `ms3 extract -N`, two new `notes` folders containing note lists are created:

```console
ms3
âââ docs
âÂ Â  âââ cujus.mscx
âÂ Â  âââ o_quam.mscx
âÂ Â  âââ quae.mscx
âÂ Â  âââ stabat.mscx
âââ notes
âÂ Â  âââ cujus.tsv
âÂ Â  âââ o_quam.tsv
âÂ Â  âââ quae.tsv
âÂ Â  âââ stabat.tsv
âââ tests
    âââ MS3
    âÂ Â  âââ 05_symph_fant.mscx
    âÂ Â  âââ 76CASM34A33UM.mscx
    âÂ Â  âââ BWV_0815.mscx
    âÂ Â  âââ D973deutscher01.mscx
    âÂ Â  âââ Did03M-Son_regina-1762-Sarti.mscx
    âÂ Â  âââ K284-3_section_breaks.mscx
    âÂ Â  âââ stabat_03_coloured.mscx
    âââ notes
    âÂ Â  âââ 05_symph_fant.tsv
    âÂ Â  âââ 76CASM34A33UM.tsv
    âÂ Â  âââ BWV_0815.tsv
    âÂ Â  âââ D973deutscher01.tsv
    âÂ Â  âââ Did03M-Son_regina-1762-Sarti.tsv
    âÂ Â  âââ K284-3_section_breaks.tsv
    âÂ Â  âââ repeats0.tsv
    âÂ Â  âââ repeats1.tsv
    âÂ Â  âââ repeats2.tsv
    âÂ Â  âââ stabat_03_coloured.tsv
    âââ repeat_dummies
        âââ repeats0.mscx
        âââ repeats1.mscx
        âââ repeats2.mscx
```

We witness this behaviour because the default value is `../notes`, interpreted as relative path in relation to
each MuseScore file. Alternatively, a **relative path** can be specified **without** initial `./` or `../`,
e.g. `ms3 extract -N notes`, to store the note lists in a recreated sub-directory structure:

```console
ms3
âââ docs
âââ notes
âÂ Â  âââ docs
âÂ Â  âââ tests
âÂ Â      âââ MS3
âÂ Â      âââ repeat_dummies
âââ tests
    âââ MS3
    âââ repeat_dummies
```

A third option consists in specifying an **absolute path** which causes all note lists to be stored in the specified
folder, e.g. `ms3 extract -N ~/notes`:

```console
~/notes
âââ 05_symph_fant.tsv
âââ 76CASM34A33UM.tsv
âââ BWV_0815.tsv
âââ cujus.tsv
âââ D973deutscher01.tsv
âââ Did03M-Son_regina-1762-Sarti.tsv
âââ K284-3_section_breaks.tsv
âââ o_quam.tsv
âââ quae.tsv
âââ repeats0.tsv
âââ repeats1.tsv
âââ repeats2.tsv
âââ stabat_03_coloured.tsv
âââ stabat.tsv
```

Note that this leads to problems if MuseScore files from different subdirectories have identical filenames.
In any case it is good practice to not use nested folders to allow for easier file access. For example, a typical
[DCML corpus](https://github.com/DCMLab/dcml_corpora) will store all MuseScore files in the `MS3` folder and
include at least the folders created by `ms3 extract -N -M -X`:

```console
.
âââ harmonies
âââ measures
âââ MS3
âââ notes
```

### Extracting score information manually

What `ms3 extract` effectively does is creating a {py:class}`~.parse.Parse` object, calling its method
{py:meth}`~.parse.Parse.parse_mscx` and then {py:meth}`~.parse.Parse.store_lists`. In addition to the
command, the method allows for storing two additional aspects, namely `notes_and_rests` and `cadences` (if
the score contains cadence labels). For each of the available aspects,
`{notes, measures, rests, notes_and_rests, events, labels, chords, cadences, expanded}`,
the method provides two parameters, namely `_folder` (where to store TSVs) and `_suffix`,
i.e. a slug appended to the respective filenames. If the parameter
`simulate=True` is passed, no files are written but the file paths to be
created are returned. Since corpora might have quite diverse directory structures,
ms3 gives you various ways of specifying folders which will be explained in detail
in the following section.

Briefly, the rules for specifying the folders are as follows:

- absolute folder (e.g. `~/labels`): Store all files in this particular folder without creating subfolders.
- relative folder starting with `./` or `../`: relative folders are created
  "at the end" of the original subdirectory structure, i.e. relative to the MuseScore
  files.
- relative folder not starting with `./` or `../` (e.g. `rests`): relative
  folders are created at the top level (of the original directory or the specified
  `root_dir`) and the original subdirectory structure is replicated
  in each of them.

To see examples for the three possibilities, see the following section.

(specifying_folders)=

#### Specifying folders

Consider a two-level folder structure contained in the root directory `.`
which is the one passed to {py:class}`~.parse.Parse`:

```console
.
âââ docs
âÂ Â  âââ cujus.mscx
âÂ Â  âââ o_quam.mscx
âÂ Â  âââ quae.mscx
âÂ Â  âââ stabat.mscx
âââ tests
    âââ MS3
        âââ 05_symph_fant.mscx
        âââ 76CASM34A33UM.mscx
        âââ BWV_0815.mscx
        âââ D973deutscher01.mscx
        âââ Did03M-Son_regina-1762-Sarti.mscx
        âââ K284-3_section_breaks.mscx
```

The first level contains the subdirectories `docs` (4 files) and `tests`
(6 files in the subdirectory `MS3`). Now we look at the three different ways to specify folders for storing notes and
measures.

##### Absolute Folders

When we specify absolute paths, all files are stored in the specified directories.
In this example, the measures and notes are stored in the two specified subfolders
of the home directory `~`, regardless of the original subdirectory structure.

```python
>>> p.store_lists(notes_folder='~/notes', measures_folder='~/measures')
```

```console
~
âââ measures
âÂ Â  âââ 05_symph_fant.tsv
âÂ Â  âââ 76CASM34A33UM.tsv
âÂ Â  âââ BWV_0815.tsv
âÂ Â  âââ cujus.tsv
âÂ Â  âââ D973deutscher01.tsv
âÂ Â  âââ Did03M-Son_regina-1762-Sarti.tsv
âÂ Â  âââ K284-3_section_breaks.tsv
âÂ Â  âââ o_quam.tsv
âÂ Â  âââ quae.tsv
âÂ Â  âââ stabat.tsv
âââ notes
    âââ 05_symph_fant.tsv
    âââ 76CASM34A33UM.tsv
    âââ BWV_0815.tsv
    âââ cujus.tsv
    âââ D973deutscher01.tsv
    âââ Did03M-Son_regina-1762-Sarti.tsv
    âââ K284-3_section_breaks.tsv
    âââ o_quam.tsv
    âââ quae.tsv
    âââ stabat.tsv
```

##### Relative Folders

In contrast, specifying relative folders recreates the original subdirectory structure.
There are two different possibilities for that. The first possibility is naming
relative folder names, meaning that the subdirectory structure (`docs` and `tests`)
is recreated in each of the folders:

```python
>>> p.store_lists(root_dir='~/tsv', notes_folder='notes', measures_folder='measures')
```

```console
~/tsv
âââ measures
âÂ Â  âââ docs
âÂ Â  âÂ Â  âââ cujus.tsv
âÂ Â  âÂ Â  âââ o_quam.tsv
âÂ Â  âÂ Â  âââ quae.tsv
âÂ Â  âÂ Â  âââ stabat.tsv
âÂ Â  âââ tests
âÂ Â      âââ MS3
âÂ Â          âââ 05_symph_fant.tsv
âÂ Â          âââ 76CASM34A33UM.tsv
âÂ Â          âââ BWV_0815.tsv
âÂ Â          âââ D973deutscher01.tsv
âÂ Â          âââ Did03M-Son_regina-1762-Sarti.tsv
âÂ Â          âââ K284-3_section_breaks.tsv
âââ notes
    âââ docs
    âÂ Â  âââ cujus.tsv
    âÂ Â  âââ o_quam.tsv
    âÂ Â  âââ quae.tsv
    âÂ Â  âââ stabat.tsv
    âââ tests
        âââ MS3
            âââ 05_symph_fant.tsv
            âââ 76CASM34A33UM.tsv
            âââ BWV_0815.tsv
            âââ D973deutscher01.tsv
            âââ Did03M-Son_regina-1762-Sarti.tsv
            âââ K284-3_section_breaks.tsv
```

Note that in this example, we have specified a `root_dir`. Leaving this argument
out will create the same structure in the directory from which the {py:class}`~.parse.Parse`
object was created, i.e. the folder structure would be:

```console
.
âââ docs
âââ measures
âÂ Â  âââ docs
âÂ Â  âââ tests
âÂ Â      âââ MS3
âââ notes
âÂ Â  âââ docs
âÂ Â  âââ tests
âÂ Â      âââ MS3
âââ tests
    âââ MS3
```

If, instead, you want to create the specified relative folders relative to each
MuseScore file's location, specify them with an initial dot. `./` means
"relative to the original path" and `../` one level up from the original path.
To exemplify both:

```python
>>> p.store_lists(root_dir='~/tsv', notes_folder='./notes', measures_folder='../measures')
```

```console
~/tsv
âââ docs
âÂ Â  âââ notes
âÂ Â      âââ cujus.tsv
âÂ Â      âââ o_quam.tsv
âÂ Â      âââ quae.tsv
âÂ Â      âââ stabat.tsv
âââ measures
âÂ Â  âââ cujus.tsv
âÂ Â  âââ o_quam.tsv
âÂ Â  âââ quae.tsv
âÂ Â  âââ stabat.tsv
âââ tests
    âââ measures
    âÂ Â  âââ 05_symph_fant.tsv
    âÂ Â  âââ 76CASM34A33UM.tsv
    âÂ Â  âââ BWV_0815.tsv
    âÂ Â  âââ D973deutscher01.tsv
    âÂ Â  âââ Did03M-Son_regina-1762-Sarti.tsv
    âÂ Â  âââ K284-3_section_breaks.tsv
    âââ MS3
        âââ notes
            âââ 05_symph_fant.tsv
            âââ 76CASM34A33UM.tsv
            âââ BWV_0815.tsv
            âââ D973deutscher01.tsv
            âââ Did03M-Son_regina-1762-Sarti.tsv
            âââ K284-3_section_breaks.tsv
```

The `notes` folders are created in directories where MuseScore files are located,
and the `measures` folders one directory above, respectively. Leaving out the
`root_dir` argument would lead to the same folder structure but in the directory
from which the {py:class}`~.parse.Parse` object has been created. In a similar manner,
the arguments `p.store_lists(notes_folder='.', measures_folder='.')` would create
the TSV files just next to the MuseScore files. However, this would lead to warnings
such as

:::{warning}
The notes at ~/ms3/docs/cujus.tsv have been overwritten with measures.
:::

In such a case we need to specify a suffix for at least one of both aspects:

```python
p.store_lists(notes_folder='.', notes_suffix='_notes',
              measures_folder='.', measures_suffix='_measures')
```

##### Examples

Before you are sure to have picked the right parameters for your desired output,
you can simply use the `simulate=True` argument which lets you view the paths
without actually creating any files. In this variant, all aspects are stored each
in individual folders but with identical filenames:

:::{caution}
The parameter `key` will be deprecated from version 0.6.0 onwards. See {ref}`keys_and_ids`.
:::

```python
>>> p = Parse('~/ms3/docs', key='pergo')
>>> p.parse_mscx()
>>> p.store_lists(  notes_folder='./notes',
                    rests_folder='./rests',
                    notes_and_rests_folder='./notes_and_rests',
                    simulate=True
                    )
['~/ms3/docs/notes/cujus.tsv',
 '~/ms3/docs/rests/cujus.tsv',
 '~/ms3/docs/notes_and_rests/cujus.tsv',
 '~/ms3/docs/notes/o_quam.tsv',
 '~/ms3/docs/rests/o_quam.tsv',
 '~/ms3/docs/notes_and_rests/o_quam.tsv',
 '~/ms3/docs/notes/quae.tsv',
 '~/ms3/docs/rests/quae.tsv',
 '~/ms3/docs/notes_and_rests/quae.tsv',
 '~/ms3/docs/notes/stabat.tsv',
 '~/ms3/docs/rests/stabat.tsv',
 '~/ms3/docs/notes_and_rests/stabat.tsv']
```

In this variant, the different ways of specifying folders are exemplified. To demonstrate all subtleties we parse the
same four files but this time from the perspective of `~/ms3`:

```python
>>> p = Parse('~/ms3', folder_re='docs', key='pergo')
>>> p.parse_mscx()
>>> p.store_lists(  notes_folder='./notes',            # relative to ms3/docs
                    measures_folder='../measures',     # one level up from ms3/docs
                    rests_folder='rests',              # relative to the parsed directory
                    labels_folder='~/labels',          # absolute folder
                    expanded_folder='~/labels', expanded_suffix='_exp',
                    simulate = True
                    )
['~/ms3/docs/notes/cujus.tsv',
 '~/ms3/rests/docs/cujus.tsv',
 '~/ms3/measures/cujus.tsv',
 '~/labels/cujus.tsv',
 '~/labels/cujus_exp.tsv',

```

(column_names)=

## Column Names

Glossary of the meaning and types of column types. In order to correctly restore the types when loading TSV files,
either use an {py:class}`~.annotations.Annotations` object or the function {py:func}`~.utils.load_tsv`.

### General Columns

(duration)=

#### **duration**

{obj}`fractions.Fraction`

Duration of an event expressed in fractions of a whole note. Note that in note lists, the duration does not take
into account if notes are {ref}`tied <tied>` together; in other words, the column expresses no durations that
surpass the final bar line.

(duration_qb)=

#### **duration_qb**

{obj}`float`

Duration expressed in quarter notes. If the column {{ duration }} is present it corresponds to that column times four.
Otherwise (e.g. for labels) it is computed from an {obj}`~pandas.IntervalIndex` created from the {{ quarterbeats }} column.

(keysig)=

#### **keysig** Key Signatures

{obj}`int`

The feature `keysig` represents the key signature of a particular measure.
It is an integer which, if positive, represents the number of sharps, and if
negative, the number of flats. E.g.: `3`: three sharps, `-2`: two flats,
`0`: no accidentals.

(mc)=

#### **mc** Measure Counts

{obj}`int`

Measure count, identifier for the measure units in the XML encoding.
Always starts with 1 for correspondence to MuseScore's status bar. For more detailed information, please refer to
{ref}`mc_vs_mn`.

(mn)=

#### **mn** Measure Numbers

{obj}`int`

Measure number, continuous count of complete measures as used in printed editions.
Starts with 1 except for pieces beginning with a pickup measure, numbered as 0. MNs are identical for first and
second endings! For more detailed information, please refer to {ref}`mc_vs_mn`.

(mc_onset)=

#### **mc_onset**

{obj}`fractions.Fraction`

The value for `mc_onset` represents, expressed as fraction of a whole note, a position in a measure where `0`
corresponds to the earliest possible position (in most cases beat 1). For more detailed information, please
refer to {ref}`onsets`.

(mn_onset)=

#### **mn_onset**

{obj}`fractions.Fraction`

The value for `mn_onset` represents, expressed as fraction of a whole note, a position in a measure where `0`
corresponds to the earliest possible position of the corresponding measure number (MN). For more detailed information,
please refer to {ref}`onsets`.

(quarterbeats)=

#### **quarterbeats**

{obj}`fractions.Fraction`

This column expresses positions, otherwise accessible only as a tuple `(mc, mc_onset)`, as a running count of
quarter notes from the piece's beginning (quarterbeat = 0). If second endings are present in the score, only the
second ending is counted in order to give authentic values to such a score, as if played without repetitions
(third endings and more are also ignored). If repetitions are unfolded, i.e. the table corresponds to a
full play-through of the score, all endings are taken into account correctly.

For the specific case you need continuous quarterbeats including all endings, please refer to {{ quarterbeats_all_endings }}.

Computation of quarterbeats requires an offset_dict that is computed from the column {{ act_dur }} contained in every
{ref}`measures` table. Quarterbeats are based on the cumulative sum of that column, meaning that they take
the length of irregular measures into account.

(staff)=

#### **staff**

{obj}`int`

In which staff an event occurs. `1` = upper staff.

(timesig)=

#### **timesig** Time Signatures

{obj}`str`

The time signature `timesig` of a particular measure is expressed as a string, e.g. `'2/2'`.
The {ref}`actual duration <act_dur>` of a measure can deviate from the time signature for notational reasons: For example,
a pickup bar could have an actual duration of `1/4`  but still be part of a `'3/8'` meter, which usually
has an actual duration of `3/8`.

(volta)=

#### **volta**

{obj}`int`

In the case of first and second (third etc.) endings, this column holds the number of every "bracket", "house", or \_volta\_,
which should increase from 1. This is required for MS3's unfold repeats function to work. For more information,
{ref}`see here <voltas>`.

(voice)=

#### **voice**

{obj}`int`

In which notational layer an event occurs. Each {ref}`staff` has (can have) up to four layers:

- `1` = upper, default layer (blue)
- `2` = second layer, downward stems (green)
- `3` = third layer, upward stems (orange)
- `4` = fourth layer, downward stems (purple)

### Measures

(act_dur)=

#### **act_dur** Actual duration of a measure

{obj}`fractions.Fraction`

The value of `act_dur` in most cases equals the time signature, expressed as a fraction; meaning for example that
a "normal" measure in 6/8 has `act_dur = 3/4`. If the measure has an irregular length, for example a pickup measure
of length 1/8, would have `act_dur = 1/8`.

The value of `act_dur` plays an important part in inferring {ref}`MNs <mn>`
from {ref}`MCs <mc>`. See also the columns {ref}`dont_count <dont_count>` and {ref}`numbering_offset <numbering_offset>`.

(barline)=

#### **barline**

{obj}`str`

The column `barline` encodes information about the measure's final bar line.

(breaks)=

#### **breaks**

{obj}`str`

The column `breaks` may include three different values: `{'line', 'page', 'section'}` which represent the different
breaks types. In the case of section breaks, MuseScore

(dont_count)=

#### **dont_count** Measures excluded from bar count

{obj}`int`

This is a binary value that corresponds to MuseScore's setting `Exclude from bar count` from the `Bar Properties` menu.
The value is `1` for pickup bars, second {ref}`MCs <mc>` of divided {ref}`MNs <mn>` and some volta measures,
and `NaN` otherwise.

(mc_offset)=

#### **mc_offset** Offset of a MC

{obj}`fractions.Fraction`

The column `mc_offset` , in most cases, has the value `0` because it expresses the deviation of this MC's
{ref}`mc_onset` `0` (beginning of the MC)
from beat 1 of the corresponding MN. If the value is a fraction > 0, it means that this MC is part of a MN which is
composed of at least two MCs, and it expresses the current MC's offset in terms of the duration of all (usually 1) preceding MCs
which are also part of the corresponding MN. In the standard case that one MN would be split in two MCs, the first MC
would have mc_offset = `0` , and the second one mc_offset = `the previous MC's` {ref}`act_dur <act_dur>` .

(next)=

#### **next**

{obj}`tuple`

Every cell in this column has at least one integer, namely the MC of the subsequent bar, or `-1` in the cast of the last.
In the case of repetitions, measures can have more than one subsequent MCs, in which case the integers are separated by
`', '` .

The column is used for checking whether {ref}`irregular measure lengths <act_dur>` even themselves out because otherwise
the inferred MNs might be wrong. Also, it is needed for MS3's unfold repetitions functionality.

(numbering_offset)=

#### **numbering_offset** Offsetting MNs

{obj}`int`

MuseScore's measure number counter can be reset at a given MC by using the `Add to bar number` setting from the
`Bar Properties` menu. If `numbering_offset` â  0, the counting offset is added to the current MN and all subsequent
MNs are inferred accordingly.

Scores which include several pieces (e.g. in variations or a suite),
sometimes, instead of using section {ref}`breaks <breaks>`, use `numbering_offset` to simulate a restart for counting
{ref}`MNs <mn>` at every new section. This leads to ambiguous MNs.

(quarterbeats_all_endings)=

#### **quarterbeats_all_endings**

{obj}`fractions.Fraction`

Since the computation of {{ quarterbeats }} for pieces including alternative endings ({ref}`voltas <volta>`) excludes all
but the second endings, the measures of such pieces get this additional column, allowing to create an offset_dict
for users who need continuous quarterbeats including all endings. In that case one would call

```python
from ms3 import add_quarterbeats_col
offset_dict = measures.quarterbeats_all_endings.to_dict()
df_with_gapless_quarterbeats = add_quarterbeats_col(df, offset_dict)
```

(repeats)=

#### **repeats**

{obj}`str`

The column `repeats` indicates the presence of repeat signs and can have the values
`{'start', 'end', 'startend', 'firstMeasure', 'lastMeasure'}`. MS3 performs a test on the
repeat signs' plausibility and throws warnings when some inference is required for this.

The `repeats` column needs to have the correct repeat sign structure in order to have a correct {ref}`next <next>`
column which, in return, is required for MS3's unfolding repetitions functionality.

### Notes and Rests

(chord_id)=

#### **chord_id**

{obj}`int`

Every note keeps the ID of the `<Chord>` tag to which it belongs in the score. This is necessary because in
MuseScore XML, most markup (e.g. articulation, lyrics etc.) are attached to {ref}`chords <chords>` rather than
to individual notes. This column allows for relating markup to notes at a later point.

(gracenote)=

#### **gracenote**

{obj}`str`

For grace notes, type of the grace note as encoded in the MuseScore source code. They are assigned a
{ref}`duration <duration>` of 0.

(midi)=

#### **midi** Piano key

{obj}`int`

MIDI pitch with `60` = C4, `61` = C#4/Db4/B##3 etc. For the actual note name, refer to the
{ref}`tpc <tpc>` column.

(nominal_duration)=

#### **nominal_duration**

{obj}`fractions.Fraction`

Note's or rest's duration without taking into account dots or tuplets. Multiplying by {ref}`scalar <scalar>`
results in the actual {ref}`duration <duration>`.

(scalar)=

#### **scalar**

{obj}`fractions.Fraction`

Value reflecting dots and tuples by which to multiply a note's or rest's {ref}`nominal_duration <nominal_duration>`.

(tied)=

#### **tied**

{obj}`int`

Encodes ties on the note's left (`-1`), on its right (`1`) or both (`0`).
A tie merges a note with an adjacent one having the same pitch.

| value | explanation                                                                                                                                            |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| \<NA> | No ties. This note represents an onset and ends after the given duration.                                                                              |
| 1     | This note is tied to the next one. It represents an onset but not a note ending.                                                                       |
| 0     | This note is being tied to and tied to the next one. It represents neither an onset nor a note ending.                                                 |
| -1    | This note is being tied to. That is, it does not represent an onset, instead it adds to the duration of a previous note on the same pitch and ends it. |

(tpc)=

#### **tpc** Tonal pitch class

{obj}`int`

Encodes note names by their position on the line of fifth with `0` = C, `1` = G, `2` = D, `-1` = F,
`-2` = Bb etc. The octave is defined by {ref}`midi <midi>` DIV 12 - 1

(tremolo)=

#### **tremolo**

{obj}`str`

The syntax for this column is `<dur>_<type>_<component>` where `<dur>` is half the duration of the tremolo,
`<type>` is the tremolo type, e.g. `c32` for 3 beams or `c64` for 4 (values taken from the source code), and
`<component>` is 1 for notes in the first and 2 for notes in the second \<Chord>.

Explanation: MuseScore 3 encodes the two components of a tremolo as two separate \<Chord> tags with half the duration of the tremolo.
This column serves to keep the information of the two components although onsets and durations in the {ref}`notes`
are corrected to represent the fact that all notes are sounding through the duration of the tremolo.

For example, an octave tremolo with duration of a dotted half note and tremolo frequency of 32nd notes will appear
in the score as a dotted half on beat 1 and another dotted half 3 eights later. In the note list, however, both notes
have `mc_onset` 0 and `duration` 3/4. The column `tremolo` has the value `3/8_c32_1` for the first note and
`3/8_c32_1` for the second.

### Chords

The various \<Chord> tags are identified by increasing integer counts in the column `chord_id`. Within a note list,
a {ref}`column of the same name <chord_id>` specifies which note belongs to which \<Chord> tag. A chord and all the
notes belonging to it have identical values in the columns {ref}`mc <mc>`, {ref}`mn <mn>`, {ref}`mc_onset <mc_onset>`,
{ref}`mn_onset <mn_onset>`, {ref}`timesig <timesig>`, {ref}`staff <staff>`, {ref}`voice <voice>`,
{ref}`duration <duration>`, {ref}`gracenote <gracenote>`, {ref}`nominal_duration <nominal_duration>`,
{ref}`scalar <scalar>`, {ref}`volta <volta>`, and of course {ref}`chord_id <chord_id>`.

(articulation)=

#### **articulation**

{obj}`str`

Articulation signs named as in the MuseScore file, e.g. `articStaccatoBelow`.

(dynamics)=

#### **dynamics**

{obj}`str`

Dynamic signs such as `p`, `ff` etc. Other dynamic markings such as `dolce` are currently displayed as
`other-dynamics`. Velocity values are currently not extracted. These features can easily be implemented
[upon request](https://github.com/johentsch/ms3/issues/).

(lyrics_1)=

#### **lyrics:1**

{obj}`str`

When a voice includes only a single verse, all syllables are contained in the column `lyrics:1`. If it has more
than one verse, for each \<Chord> the last verse's syllable is contained in the respective column, e.g. `lyrics:3` if
the 3rd verse is the last one with a syllable for this chord. Each syllable has a trailing `-` if it's the first
syllable of a word, a leading `-` if it's the last syllable of a word, and both if it's in the middle of a word.

(qpm)=

#### **qpm** Quarter notes per minute

{obj}`int`

Defined for every {{ tempo }} mark. Normalizes the metronome value to quarter notes. For example, `ð. = 112` gets the
value `qbm = 112 * 1.5 = 168`.

(staff_text)=

#### **staff_text**

{obj}`str`

Free-form text such as `dolce` or `div.`. Depending on the encoding standard, this layer may include dynamics
such as `cresc.`, articulation such as `stacc.`, movement titles, and many more. Staff texts are added in MuseScore
via `[C] + T`.

(system_text)=

#### **system_text**

Free-form text not attached to a particular staff but to the entire system. This frequently includes movement names or
playing styles such as `Swing`. System texts are added in MuseScore via `[C] + [S] + T`.

(tempo)=

#### **tempo**

Metronome markings and tempo texts. Unfortunately, for tempo texts that include a metronome mark, e.g.
`Larghetto. (ð = 63)`, the text before the ð symbol is lost. This can be fixed
[upon request](https://github.com/johentsch/ms3/issues/).

(spanners)=

#### Spanners

{obj}`str` (-> {obj}`tuple`)

Spanners designate markup that spans several \<Chord> tags, such as slurs, hairpins, pedal, trill and ottava lines. The values
in a spanner column are IDs such that all chords with the same ID belong to the same spanner. Each cell can have more
than one ID, separated by commas. For evaluating spanner columns, the values should be turned into tuples.

Spanners span all chords belonging to the same {{ staff }}, except for slurs and trills which span only chords in the same {{ voice }}. In
other words, won't find the ending of a slur that goes from one {{ voice }} to another.

(slur)=

##### **slur**

{obj}`str` (-> {obj}`tuple`)

Slurs expressing legato and/or phrasing. These {ref}`spanners <spanners>` always pertain to a particular {{ voice }}.

(hairpins)=

##### **(de)crescendo_hairpin**

{obj}`str` (-> {obj}`tuple`)

`crescendo_hairpin` is a `<` {ref}`spanner <spanners>`, `decrescendo_hairpin` a `>` {ref}`spanner <spanners>`.
These always pertain to an entire {{ staff }}.

(cresc_lines)=

##### **crescendo_line**, **diminuendo_line**

{obj}`str` (-> {obj}`tuple`)

These are {ref}`spanners <spanners>` starting with a word, by default `cresc.` or `dim.`, followed by a dotted line.
These always pertain to an entire {{ staff }}.

(ottava)=

##### **Ottava**

{obj}`str` (-> {obj}`tuple`)

These {ref}`spanners <spanners>` are always specified with a subtype such as `Ottava:8va` or `Ottava:15mb`. They
always pertain to an entire {{ staff }}

(pedal)=

##### **pedal**

{obj}`str` (-> {obj}`tuple`)

Pedal line {ref}`spanners <spanners>` always pertain to an entire {{ staff }}.

(textline)=

#### **TextLine**

{obj}`str` (-> {obj}`tuple`)

Custom staff text with a line that can be prolonged at will.

(trill)=

#### **Trill**

{obj}`str`

Trills {ref}`spanners <spanners>` can have different subtypes specified after a colon, e.g. `'Trill:trill'`.
They always pertain to a particular {{ voice }}.

### Labels

(harmony_layer)=

#### **harmony_layer**

{obj}`int`

This column indicates the harmony layer, or label type, in/as which a label has been stored.
It is an integer within \[0, 3\] that indicates how it is encoded in MuseScore.

| harmony_layer | explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0             | Label encoded in MuseScore's chord layer (Add->Text->Chord Symbol, or \[C\]+K) that does not start with a note name, i.e. MuseScore did not recognize it as an absolute chord and encoded it as plain text (compare type 3).    |
| 1             | Roman Numeral (Add->Text->Roman Numeral Analysis).                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 2             | Nashville number (Add->Text->Nashville Number).                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 3             | Label encoded in MuseScore's chord layer (Add->Text->Chord Symbol, or \[C\]+K) that does start with a note name, i.e. MuseScore did recognize it as an absolute chord and encoded its root (and bass note) as numerical values. |

(label)=

#### **label**

{obj}`str`

Annotation labels from MuseScores \<Harmony> tags. Depending on the {{ label_type }} the column can include complete
strings (decoded) or partial strings (encoded).

(regex_match)=

#### **regex_match**

{obj}`str`

Name of the first regular expression that matched a label, e.g. 'dcml'.

(label_type)=

#### **label_type**

:::{warning}
Deprecated since 0.6.0 where this column has been split and replaced by {{ harmony_layer }} and {{ regex_match }}
:::

{obj}`str`

See {ref}`label types <label_types>` above.

(offset)=

#### **offset_x** and **offset_y**

{obj}`float`

Offset positions for labels whose position has been manually altered. Of importance mainly for re-inserting labels into a score at
the exact same position.

### Expanded

(alt_label)=

{obj}`str`

Alternative reading to the {{ label }}. Generally considered "second choice" compared to the "main label" that has been expanded.

(bass_note)=

#### **bass_note**

{obj}`int`

The bass note designated by the label, expressed as {ref}`scale degree <fifths>`.

(cadence)=

#### **cadence**

{obj}`str`

Currently allows for the values

| value | cadence             |
| ----- | ------------------- |
| PAC   | perfect authentic   |
| IAC   | imperfect authentic |
| HC    | half                |
| DC    | deceptive           |
| EC    | evaded              |
| PC    | plagal              |

(chord)=

#### **chord**

{obj}`str`

This column stands in no relation to the \<Chord> tags {ref}`discussed above <chords>`. Instead, it holds the substring
of the original labels that includes only the actual chord label, i.e. excluding information about modulations,
pedal tones, phrases, and cadences. In other words, it comprises the features {{ numeral }}, {{ form }}, {{ figbass }}, {{ changes }},
and {{ relativeroot }}.

(chord_tones)=

#### **chord_tones**, **added_tones**

{obj}`str` (-> {obj}`tuple`)

Chord tones designated by the label, expressed as {ref}`scale degrees <fifths>`. Includes 3 scale degrees for triads,
4 for tetrads, ordered according to the inversion (i.e. the first value is the {{ bass_note }}). Accounts for chord tone
replacement expressed through intervals \<= 8 within parentheses, without leading +.
`added_tones` reflects only those non-chord tones that were added using, again within parentheses,
intervals preceded by + or/and greater than 8.

(chord_type)=

#### **chord_type**

{obj}`str`

A summary of information that otherwise depends on the three columns {{ numeral }}, {{ form }}, {{ figbass }}.
It can be one of the wide-spread abbreviations for triads: `M, m, o, +` or for seventh chords: `o7, %7, +7, +M7`
(for diminished, half-diminished and augmented chords with minor/major seventh),
or `Mm7, mm7, MM7, mM7` for all combinations of a major/minor triad with a minor/major seventh.

(figbass)=

#### **figbass** Inversion

Figured bass notation of the chord inversion. For triads, this feature can be `<NA>, '6', '64'`,
for seventh chords `'7', '65', '43', '2'`. This column plays into computing the {{ chord_type }}.
This feature is decisive for {ref}`which chord tone is in the bass <bass_note>`.

(form)=

#### **form**

{obj}`str`

This column conveys part of the information what {{ chord_type }} a label expresses.

| value    | chord type                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| \<NA>    | If {{ figbass }} is one of `<NA>, '6', '64'`, the chord is either a major or minor triad. Otherwise, it is either a major or a minor chord with a minor seventh. |
| o, +     | Diminished or augmented chord. Again, it depends on {{ figbass }} whether it is a triad or a seventh chord.                                                      |
| %, M, +M | Half diminished or major seventh chord. For the latter, the chord form (MM7 or mM7) depends on the {{ numeral }}.                                                |

(globalkey)=

#### **globalkey**

{obj}`str`

Tonality of the piece, expressed as absolute note name, e.g. `Ab` for A flat major, or `g#` for G sharp minor.

(globalkey_is_minor)=

#### **globalkey_is_minor**

{obj}`bool`

Auxiliary column which is True if the {{ globalkey }} is a minor key, False otherwise.

(localkey)=

#### **localkey**

{obj}`str`

Local key expressed as Roman numeral relative to the {{ globalkey }}, e.g. `IV` for the major key on the 4th scale degree
or `#iv` for the minor scale on the raised 4th scale degree.

(localkey_is_minor)=

#### **localkey_is_minor**

{obj}`bool`

Auxiliary column which is True if the {{ localkey }} is a minor key, False otherwise.

(numeral)=

#### **numeral**

{obj}`str`

Roman numeral defining the chordal root relative to the local key. An uppercase numeral stands for a major chordal
third, lowercase for a minor third. The column {{ root }} expresses the same information as {ref}`scale degree <fifths>`.

(phraseend)=

#### **phraseend** Phrase annotations

In versions \< 2.2.0, only phrase endings where annotated, designated by `\\`. From version 2.2.0 onwards,
`{` means beginning and `}` ending of a phrase. Everything between `}` and the subsequent `{` is to be
considered as part of the previous phrase, a 'codetta' after the strong end point.

(relativeroot)=

#### **relativeroot** Tonicized key

{obj}`str`

This feature designates a lower-level key to which the current chord relates. It is expressed relative to the local key.
For example, if the current {{ numeral }} is a `V` and it is a secondary dominant,
relativeroot is the Roman numeral of the key that is being tonicized.

(root)=

#### **root**

{obj}`int`

The {{ numeral }} expressed as {ref}`scale degree <fifths>`.

### Metadata

If not otherwise specified, metadata fields are of type {obj}`str`.

(piece)=

#### **piece**

{obj}`str`

:::{admonition} Metadata category
File information about the score described by this set of metadata.
:::

File name without extension. Serves as ID for linking files that belong to the same piece although they might have
different suffixes and file extensions. It follows that only files will be detected as belonging to this score whose
file names are at least as long. In other words, the main score file that is to be considered as the most up-to-date
version of the data should ideally not come with a suffix.

(rel_path)=

#### **rel_path**

{obj}`str`

:::{admonition} Metadata category
File information about the score described by this set of metadata.
:::

Relative file path of the score, including extension.

Metadata extracted with older versions of ms3 (\<1.0.0) would come instead with the column `rel_paths` which would
include the relative folder path without the file itself. This value can now be found in the column
{ref}`subdirectory`.

(subdirectory)=

#### **subdirectory**

{obj}`str`

:::{admonition} Metadata category
File information about the score described by this set of metadata.
:::

Folder where the score is located, relative to the corpus_path. Equivalent to {ref}`rel_path` but without the file.

(composer)=

#### **composer**

{obj}`str`

:::{admonition} Metadata category
Default metadata field in MuseScore's *Score Properties*. Can be updated using the command `ms3 metadata`.
:::

Composer name as it would figure in the English Wikipedia (although middle names may be dropped).

(worktitle)=

#### **workTitle**

{obj}`str`

:::{admonition} Metadata category

:::

Title of the whole composition (cycle), even if the score holds only a part of it. It should not contain opus or other
catalogue numbers, which go into the {ref}`workNumber` column/field.

The title of the part included in this score, be it a movement or, for instance, a song within a song cycle, goes
into the {ref}`movementTitle` column/field.

(composed_start)=

#### **composed_start**

{obj}`str` of length 4 or `..`

:::{admonition} Metadata category
Custom metadata field in MuseScore's *Score Properties*. Can be updated using the command `ms3 metadata`.
:::

Year in which the composing began. If there is evidence that composing the piece took more than one year but only the
{ref}`composed_end` of the time span is known, this value should be `..`. In all other cases the string should be composed of
four integers so that it can be converted to a number.

Collecting `(composed_start, composed_end)` year values was a conscious decision against more elaborate indications
such as the [Extended Date/Time Format (EDTF)](https://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/), based on a trade-off.

(composed_end)=

(last_mn)=

#### **last_mn**

{obj}`int`

:::{admonition} Metadata category
Computed by ms3.
:::

Last {ref}`measure number <mn>` (i.e., the length of the score as number of complete measures).

(last_mn_unfolded)=

#### **last_mn_unfolded**

{obj}`int`

:::{admonition} Metadata category
Computed by ms3.
:::

Number of measures when playing all repeats.

(length_qb)=

#### **length_qb**

{obj}`float`

:::{admonition} Metadata category

:::

Length of the piece, measured in quarter notes.

(length_qb_unfolded)=

#### **length_qb_unfolded**

{obj}`float`

:::{admonition} Metadata category

:::

Length of the piece when playing all repeats, measured in quarter notes.

(volta_mcs)=

#### **volta_mcs**

{obj}`tuple`

:::{admonition} Metadata category
Computed by ms3.
:::

{ref}`Measure counts <mc>` of first and second (and further) endings. For example, `(((16,), (17,)), ((75, 76), (77, 78)))`
would stand for two sets of two brackets, the first one with two endings of length 1 (probably measure numbers 16a
and 16b) and the second one for two endings of length 2, starting in MC 75.

The name comes from Italian "prima/seconda volta" for "first/second time".

(all_notes_qb)=

#### **all_notes_qb**

{obj}`float`

:::{admonition} Metadata category
Computed by ms3.
:::

Summed up duration of all notes, measured in quarter notes.

(n_onsets)=

#### **n_onsets**

{obj}`int`

:::{admonition} Metadata category
Computed by ms3.
:::

Number of all note onsets. This number is at most the number of rows in the corresponding notes table which, in return,
is the number of all note *heads*. `n_onsets` does not count tied-to note heads (which do not represent onsets).

(n_onset_positions)=

#### **n_onset_positions**

{obj}`int`

:::{admonition} Metadata category
Computed by ms3.
:::

Number of unique note onsets ("slices").

(guitar_chord_count)=

#### **guitar_chord_count**

{obj}`int`

:::{admonition} Metadata category
Computed by ms3.
:::

Number of all \<Harmony> labels that do not match the [DCML harmony annotation standard](https://github.com/DCMLab/standards).
In most cases, they will be so-called guitar or Jazz chords ("changes") as used in lead sheets, pop and folk songs, etc.

(label_count)=

#### **label_count**

{obj}`int`

:::{admonition} Metadata category
Computed by ms3.
:::

Number of chord labels that match the [DCML harmony annotation standard](https://github.com/DCMLab/standards).

For metadata extracted with older versions of ms3 (\<1.0.0) this value would represent the number of all \<Harmony>
labels including {ref}`guitar/Jazz chords <guitar_chord_count>`.

(key_signatures)=

#### **KeySig** Key signatures

{obj}`str`

:::{admonition} Metadata category
Computed by ms3.
:::

Key signature(s) (negative = flats, positive = sharps) and their position(s) in the score. A score in C major would have
the value `1: 0`, i.e. zero accidentals in {ref}`MC <mc>` 1, the first \<Measure> tag. A score with the key signatures
of C minor (3 flats), G minor (1 flat) and G major (1 sharp) could have, for example, `1: -3, 39: -1, 67: 1`. In
other words, the values are like dictionaries without curly braces.

The column name is in CamelCase, other than the {ref}`keysig` column found in {ref}`measures` tables.

(time_signatures)=

#### **TimeSig** Time Signatures

{obj}`str`

:::{admonition} Metadata category
Computed by ms3.
:::

Time signature(s) and their position(s) in the score. A score entirely in 4/4 would have
the value `1: 4/4`, where 1 is the {ref}`MC <mc>` of the first \<Measure> tag. A score with time signature changes
could have, for example, `1: 4/4, 39: 6/8, 67: 4/4`. In other words, the values are like dictionaries without curly braces.

The column name is in CamelCase, other than the {ref}`timesig` column found in {ref}`measures` tables.

(musescore)=

#### **musescore**

{obj}`str`

:::{admonition} Metadata category
Computed by ms3.
:::

MuseScore version that has been used to save this score, e.g. `3.6.2`.
