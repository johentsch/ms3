  abstract = {This article describes a new expert-labelled dataset featuring harmonic, phrase, and cadence analyses of all piano sonatas by W.A. Mozart. The dataset draws on the DCML standard for harmonic annotation and is being published adopting the FAIR principles of Open Science. The annotations have been verified using a data triangulation procedure which is presented as an alternative approach to handling annotator subjectivity. This procedure is suited for ensuring consistency, within the dataset and beyond, despite the high level of analytical detail afforded by the employed harmonic annotation syntax. The harmony labels also encode contextual information and are therefore suited for investigating music theoretical questions related to tonal harmony and the harmonic makeup of cadences in the classical style. Apart from providing basic statistical analyses characterizing the dataset, its music theoretical potential is illustrated by two preliminary experiments, one on the terminal harmonies of cadences and the other on the relation between performance durations and harmonic density. Furthermore, particular features can be selected to produce more coarse-grained training data, for example for chord detection algorithms that require less analytical detail. Facilitating the dataset's reusability, it comes with a Python script that allows researchers to easily access various representations of the data tailored to their particular needs.}

  abstract = {The creation and curation of labeled datasets can be an arduous, expensive, and time-consuming task. We introduce a workflow paradigm for remote consensus-building between expert annotators, while considerably reducing the associated administrative overhead through automation. Most music annotation tasks rely heavily on human interpretation and therefore defy the concept of an objective and indisputable ground truth. Thus, our paradigm invites and documents inter-annotator controversy based on a transparent set of analytical criteria, and aims at putting forth the consensual solutions emerging from such deliberations. The workflow that we suggest traces the entire genesis of annotation data, including the relevant discussions between annotators, reviewers, and curators. It adopts a well-proven pattern from collaborative software development, namely distributed version control, and allows for the automation of repetitive maintenance tasks, such as validity checks, message dispatch, or updates of meta- and paradata. To demonstrate the workflow's effectiveness, we introduce one possible implementation through GitHub Actions and showcase its success in creating cadence, phrase, and harmony annotations for a corpus of 36 trio sonatas by Arcangelo Corelli. Both code and annotated scores are freely available and the implementation can be readily used in and adapted for other MIR projects.},

This transformation is most notable in the field of systematic musicology, which developed from ``a mere extension of musicology'' into a ``complete reorientation of the discipline to fundamental questions which are non-historical in nature, [encompassing] research into the nature and properties of music as an acoustical, psychological and cognitive phenomenon'' (Duckles \& Pasler, 2001). Three recent strands of music research will be briefly discussed, namely empirical, computational, and cognitive musicology. They will be interpreted in the context of the ``cognitive revolution'' in the humanities and the sciences.},

It is proposed that the choice of methodological approach for any given research program is guided by moral and esthetic considerations. Careful assessment of these risks may suggest choosing an unorthodox method, such as quantitative methods in history, or deconstruction in science. It is argued that methodological tools (such as Ockham's razor) should not be mistaken for philosophical world-views.

  abstract = {The harmonic analysis of a musical composition is a fundamental step towards understanding its structure. Central to this analysis is the labeling of segments of a piece with chord symbols and local key information. In this work, we propose a modular system for performing such a harmonic analysis, incorporating spelled pitches (i.e., not treating enharmonically equivalent pitches as identical) and using a very large vocabulary of 1540 chords (each with a root, type, and inversion) and 70 keys (with a tonic and mode), leading to a full harmonic characterization similar to Roman numeral analysis. Our system's modular design allows each of its components to model an aspect of harmony at an appropriate level of granularity, and also aids in both flexibility and interpretability. We show that our system improves upon a state-of-the-art model for the task, both on a previously available corpus consisting mostly of pieces from the Classical and Romantic eras of Western music, as well as on a much larger corpus spanning a wider range from the 16th through the 20th centuries.},

  abstract = {Tonality has been the cornerstone of Western music-theoretical discourse for centuries. This study addresses the subject, using traditional music analysis, data-driven corpus methods, and computational models, concentrating on historical changes of tonality with a particular focus on the 19th century. The thesis engages three analytical levels of increasing scope\textemdash{} micro, meso, and macro\textemdash and is thus located between the poles of the particular and the general. The micro-level presents a detailed analysis of Franz Liszt's Sonetto 47 del Petrarca, S. 161, no. 4 (1858), in order to illustrate compositional innovations testifying to the radical changes in tonality within the 19th century. The analysis exemplifies how these novelties permeate musical compositions in that period, and also expose the benefits and limitations of manual music analysis. The meso-level examines a corpus of harmonic annotations of pieces by Beethoven, Schubert, Chopin, Liszt, Dvo\v{r}\'ak, Grieg, Tchaikovsky, Debussy, and Medtner, containing over 75,000 chord symbols. It presents a comprehensive model for the analysis of chord symbols in large corpora in order to study chords and the progressions between them. Whilst the individual composers' chord vocabularies vary considerably\textemdash paying tribute to idiomatic usages of harmony\textemdash it is shown that the overarching similarities of the chord distributions point to similarities in their harmonic language that surpass individual traits and that can be modeled by Zipf's and Heaps's laws. An entropy-based method is presented to systematically study the effect of certain features on chord prediction, revealing that suspensions are the strongest predictors. The study shows that chord progressions are largely asymmetrical and proceed mostly by fifths; however, third-based progressions become increasingly prevalent within the studied period. The macro-level explores a corpus of nearly 3 million notes in more than 2000 pieces created by 75 composers, comprising a historical range of approximately 600 years. The encoding of the data distinguishes enharmonically equivalent notes, hence providing a larger note vocabulary than most previous approaches in empirical music research. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) shows that the line of fifths can be derived from the co-occurrence as well as the co- evolution of tonal pitch-classes. Moreover, the hierarchical topic model known as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is used to discover latent tonal profiles. These largely correspond to distributions on contiguous line-of-fifths segments and moreover demonstrate the elevated roles of fifths as well as major and minor thirds as intervals between the most frequent notes. This motivates to model pieces as distributions on the Tonnetz. To that end, a new model, the Tonal Diffusion Model (TDM), is introduced. The results are obtained by fitting the model to the corpus and exhibit two trends. Over the entire historical period under consideration, notes are primarily distributed along the fifths axis of the Tonnetz. Furthermore, 19th-century composers also explore the major and minor thirds axes of the Tonnetz, extending their compositions in ever farther regions. The diverse methodology in this study provides quantitatively grounded insights from a range of perspectives, bridging the fields of music theory, computational musicology, mathematical modeling, and the digital humanities.},

There is, however, a need for a tool that can natively render the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) notation encodings that are increasingly used in music research projects. In this paper, we present Verovio, a library and toolkit for rendering MEI. A significant advantage of Verovio is that it implements MEI's structure internally, making it the best suited solution for rendering features that make MEI unique. Verovio is designed as a fast, portable, lightweight tool written in pure standard C++ with no dependencies on third-party frameworks or libraries. It can be used as a command-line rendering tool, as a library, or it can be compiled to JavaScript using the Emscripten LLVM-to-JavaScript compiler. This last option is particularly interesting because it provides a complete in-browser music MEI typesetter. The SVG output from Verovio is organized in such a way that the MEI structure is preserved as much as possible. Since every graphic in SVG is an XML element that is easily addressable, Verovio is particularly well-suited for interactive applications, especially in web browsers. Verovio is available under the GPL open-source license.},

The umbrella of digital humanities research now also includes digital publishing, philosophies of digital research, and ``born digital'' projects that cannot exist outside of a digital medium (e.g., virtual reality or 3D modeling).
