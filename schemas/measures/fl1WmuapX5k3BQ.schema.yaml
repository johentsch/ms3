  - name: quarterbeats_all_endings
    type: string
    title: Offset from Beginning (Including Endings)

    title: Time Signature
    description: Given as string, e.g. "4/4".
  - name: act_dur
    type: string
    title: Actual Length
    description: How long a measure actually lasts, which can deviate from the time
      signature. Relevant, for example, for pickup measures, split measures, cadenzas.
    constraints:
      pattern: \d+(?:\/\d+)?
  - name: mc_offset
    type: string
    title: Offset of Encoded Measure
    description: Distance of a <Measure> from the beginning of the logical measure,
      expressed as fraction of a whole note. Relevant only for split and anacrusis
      measures, 0 otherwise.
    constraints:
      pattern: \d+(?:\/\d+)?
