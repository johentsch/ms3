  - name: mc
    type: integer
    title: Measure Count
    description: Running count of encoded <Measure> tags which do not necessarily
      express a full measure (e.g. in case of an anacrusis).
    constraints:
      required: true
  - name: mn
    type: string
    title: Measure Number
    description: Measure number as printed in the score, computed from mc, dont_count
      and numbering_offset.
  - name: quarterbeats
    type: string
    title: Offset from Beginning
    description: Distance of an event from the piece's beginning. By default, only
      second endings are taken into account to reflect the proportions of a simply
      playthrough without repeats.
    constraints:
      pattern: \d+(?:\/\d+)?
  - name: duration_qb
    type: number
    title: Duration in â™©
    description: A float corresponding to duration * 4
  - name: mc_onset
    type: string
    title: Offset within Encoded Measure
    description: Distance of an event from the beginning of the <Measure> tag.
    constraints:
      pattern: \d+(?:\/\d+)?
  - name: mn_onset
    type: string
    title: Offset within Logical Measure
    description: Distance from the beginning of the logical measure. Relevant, for
      example, to compute the metric position of an event.
    constraints:
      pattern: \d+(?:\/\d+)?
  - name: timesig
    type: string
    title: Time Signature
    description: Given as string, e.g. "4/4".
  - name: staff
    type: integer
    title: Staff
    description: Number of the staff where an event occurs, 1 designating the top
      staff.
  - name: voice
    type: integer
    title: Notational Layer
    description: A number between 1-4 where 1 is MuseScore's default layer (blue),
      2 the second layer in green with downward stems, etc.
  - name: duration
    type: string
    title: Duration
    description: As fraction of a whole note.
    constraints:
      pattern: \d+(?:\/\d+)?
  - name: nominal_duration
    type: string
    title: Nominal Duration
    description: The duration corresponding to a note/rest value without applying
      any dots or n-tuplets, as fraction of a whole note. Multiplied with "scalar"
      to yield the actual duration of the note/rest.
    constraints:
      pattern: \d+(?:\/\d+)?
  - name: scalar
    type: string
    title: Scalar
    description: Decimal value reflecting all dots and n-tuplets modifying the duration
      of a note/rest. Yields the actual duration when multiplied with "nominal_duration".
    constraints:
      pattern: \d+(?:\/\d+)?
